        "\n",
        "This notebook implements two variants of the **Unrestricted Search** algorithm. The unrestricted search method is a bracketing technique used to find an interval containing the minimum of any unimodal function.\n",

        "\n",
        "The unrestricted search method finds an **interval of uncertainty** that brackets the minimum of a unimodal function. This implementation can be used with any objective function by simply modifying the `eval_fun()` function.\n",

        "### Example Objective Function\n",
        "The current implementation uses:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def eval_fun(x):\n",
        "    return x * (x - 1.5)  # f(x) = x² - 1.5x\n",
